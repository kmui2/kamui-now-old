It's zingers!

Zing zoo zing. Zeng zoo zing. Zhee joo john. Zing Zing Zing. 

Two days ago, zing zoo zing slept here as always. He left an avocado and half cut uneaten watermelon on the table. Before he left for a meeting with his friend Kai, he left the mechanical keyboard and bluetooth speakers for me. He didn't help cleanup much but he went around trying his best to pick up his crap on the floor. Of the stuff here, his occuppied half of the room before it was all organized by the cleaning service here. Most of the dishes from the kitchen were Daniel's and they were left untouched. Zing showed me the warning letter from JSM about evicting them from JSM if they didn't clean up their mess. Most of my tubs were moved to the closet in zuoyi's room, and Stephen's things were all gone.

Later, we came back from Grand Stay Hotel to see that zing had slept on the floor rathder thgan on the top bunk bed. He didn't like the top for many reasons. Then, we saw that zing forgot lots of things like the watermelon and the corn on the floor. Zuoyi agrees that he's a baby who is really nice.
